{"title": "Solubility Prediction", "details": "Solubility predictor with uncertainty. Model is a bidirectional LSTM that predict standard deviation and mean. An ensemble of 10 is combined for predictions. Epistemic uncertainty comes from model disagreement.", "use": "Organic molecules", "factors": "Model may not generalize to large molecules, very insoluble (< -12.5 logS), and highly soluble (> 1 logS), ions, or metals.", "metrics": "Test correlation 0.76. Test MAE 1.37",  "evaluation": "Withheld examples (test data)",  "training": "9982 molecules, which was augmented to 96625 molecules.",  "caveats": "Check the parity plot to see where your molecule falls relative to the training curve.",  "ethics": "None noted",  "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ur-whitelab/exmol.io/main/models/rnn-fit.png"}
