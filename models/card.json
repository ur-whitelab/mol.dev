{"title": "Solubility Prediction", "details": "Solubility predictor with uncertainty. Model is a bidirectional LSTM that predict standard deviation and mean. An esnemble of 5 is combined for predictions. Epistemic uncertainty comes from model disagreement.", "use": "Organic molecules", "factors": "Model may not generalize to large molecules, very soluble (< -12.5 logS), and highly solbule (> 1 logS), ions, or metals.", "metrics": "Test correlation 0.78. Test MAE 1.29", "evaluation": "Withheld examples (test data)", "training": "9982 molecules, which was augmented to 96625 molecules.", "caveats": "Check the parity plot to see where your molecule falls relative to the training curve.", "ethics": "None noted", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ur-whitelab/exmol.io/main/models/rnn-fit.png"}
